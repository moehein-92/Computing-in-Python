french_dict = {"me": "moi", "hello": "bonjour",

#Write a function called french2eng that takes in one string
#parameter called sentence. french2eng should look at each
#word in the sentence and translate it into French if it is
#found in the dictionary, french_dict. If a word is not found
#in the dictionary, do not translate it: use the original
#word. Then, the function should return a string of the
#translated sentence.
#
def french2eng(sentence):
    sentence = sentence.lower()
    string = sentence.split()
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i] in french_dict.keys():
            string[i] = french_dict[string[i]]
    sentence = ' '.join(string)
    return sentence





#You may assume that the sentence you're translating has no
#punctuation. However, you should convert it to lower case
#before translating.
#
#For example:
#
#  french2eng("Hello it's me") -> "bonjour it's moi"
#
#Hint: Use .split() to get a list of strings representing
#each word in the string, then use ' '.join to merge the
#translated list back into one string.
#
#Hint 2: Remember, lists are mutable, so we can change
#individual items in the list. However, to change an item
#in a list, we must change it using its index. We can
#write lines like my_words[1] = new_word.
#
#Hint 3: If you're stuck, try breaking it down into small
#parts. How do you access an item from a list? How do you
#look up a key in a dictionary? How do you change the
#value of an item in a list? How do you check if a key is
#in the dictionary?

#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: bonjour it's moi
print(french2eng("Hello it's me"))
